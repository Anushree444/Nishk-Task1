# Nishk-Task1

Tinkercad Arduino simulations for Nishk Task 1 — built for life support and emergency response systems on Mars.

## Project Overview

###  Project 1: Motion Detection System
- **Component**: PIR Motion Sensor  
- **Function**: Detects motion and turns on an LED.  
- **Use Case**: Useful for detecting movement of living beings or objects near the rover.

###  Project 2: Solar Tracking System
- **Component**: Two LDRs and a Servo  
- **Function**: Tracks sunlight and moves a servo motor to align toward the brightest light.  
- **Use Case**: Helps in adjusting solar panels for optimal energy collection.

###  Project 3: Mars Emergency Flap
- **Component**: Temperature Sensor and Servo Motor  
- **Function**: Monitors Mars temperature. If it's too low (<5°C) or too high (>40°C), it activates an emergency flap and LED warning.  
- **Use Case**: Protects sensitive systems from extreme Martian temperatures.
